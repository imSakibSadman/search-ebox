# Search fs.ebox.live
This is like a search engine for this website: 'https://fs.ebox.live'

So [this site](http://fs.ebox.live) does not have a search feature to search across folders.
I scraped all the links and titles of files and folders with Python and created a express-nodejs app with firebase to search across the scraped data.
To search go to [this site](https://ebox-17291.web.app).<br> 
To Download a file click on the name and to go to the parent folder of that file click on the catagorey.
